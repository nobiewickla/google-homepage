This is the first proper Odin Project.
It appears to be about making:

1	- the basic Google homepage (html/css I think, layout only in other words)

2	- an optional "advanced" part which I think will include some sort of actual, active search function. Using what I don't know but I'm guessing Ruby because I thing Perl is dead?)
